Everything has a past. Everything has a future.
Things are constantly changing, evolving.. growing. The world of web is no
different. In a world full of technology,
will we ever stop reinventing? If you take a look at the history of the web,
it isn’t hard to tell what the future holds within it. Think of how you would
use the computer only just 30 years ago versus now. Developers are continuously
creating bigger, bolder and better ways for us to interact with our computers.
I think that there will never be an end to the web. There will never be a day
where we have seen it all and reached a dead end. To me that’s the beauty of
it.

We’ve come to a day in age where technology is becoming a foundation of the
human existence.Look around. I bet you can’t make a full circle without seeing
something that has to do with software development of some form. At this point,
we have to keep updating and creating. </li>
